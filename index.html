        <p>The peacock, scientifically known as Pavo cristatus, is one of the most recognizable and iconic birds in the world. Here are some key facts about the peacock:

            1.  Physical Appearance : Peacocks are known for their stunning plumage, particularly the male peafowl, which is called a peacock. The male peacock is adorned with iridescent blue and green feathers, along with a long, extravagant tail that can span several feet when fully fanned out. This tail, called a "train," is used in elaborate courtship displays.
            2.  Species : There are three species of peafowl: the Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), the Green peafowl (Pavo muticus), and the Congo peafowl (Afropavo congensis). The Indian peafowl is the most well-known and is native to the Indian subcontinent.
            3.  Habitat : Peafowl are native to South Asia, including countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. However, they have also been introduced to many other parts of the world and are commonly found in captivity in zoos and parks.
            4.  Behavior : Peafowl are generally social birds and can often be found in small groups called "parties" or "musters." The males, or peacocks, are known for their elaborate courtship displays, where they fan out their tail feathers and strut around in front of females to attract a mate.
            5.  Diet : Peafowl are omnivores and typically feed on a diet consisting of seeds, insects, small reptiles, and plants.
            6.  Symbolism : The peacock has been a symbol of beauty, pride, and royalty in many cultures throughout history. In Hindu mythology, the peacock is associated with various gods and goddesses. In Christianity, the peacock has been used as a symbol of resurrection and immortality.
            7.  Conservation : While the Indian peafowl is not considered endangered, habitat loss and hunting pose threats to some populations of peafowl, particularly the Green peafowl, which is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
            Overall, the peacock is a magnificent bird known for its striking appearance and cultural significance.</p>
